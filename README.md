# HearYourFeelings
Hear Your Feelings is a song suggestion algorithm based on emotion. It captures your emotion via a camera and takes the user to a youtube video with a playlist of songs that you can give a listen to so that it matches your mood and compliments it.

This is a simple system made using Google open source ai framework Tensorflow and Keras. The model used for training is Keras sequential model which was populated with 3 CNNs, 3 MaxPool2D layers and ReLU to tackle the problem of non-linearity. The dataset utilized was from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge). This dataset was suitable to this project because it had 48x48 images of different people with different emotions and labelled accordingly which only included the essential features of the face required to categorize the image. This was important because it would eliminate or reduce the chances of overfitting while training the model to improve accuracy.
